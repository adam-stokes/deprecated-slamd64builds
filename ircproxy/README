  README


  The ircproxy is a multi-user IRC bouncer written in C for UNIX
  compatible systems.

  It can proxy simultaneous users at the same time to different IRC servers.
  The IRC connection will stay connected to IRC when the IRC client disconnects,
  so that the user can later reattach to the same connection. Private messages
  can be logged, so that the user can read it when reattaching to the IRC
  connection. It is also possible to attach multiple IRC clients on the same
  IRC connection.

  Read the INSTALL file for instructions on how to configure, compile and
  install the ircproxy.

  A list of commands for the ircproxy:


  PCONNLIST					List your possible connections.
  PCONNECT <Connection name> <Server>		Connect to a specific server.
  PQUIT <Connection name>			Request the connection to quit from IRC.
  PATTACH <Connection name>			Attach a specific connection.
  PDETACH					Detach from a connection.
