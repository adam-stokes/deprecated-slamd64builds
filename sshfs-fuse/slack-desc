# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

sshfs-fuse: sshfs-fuse (A filesystem client for FUSE, based on ssh)
sshfs-fuse:
sshfs-fuse: Sshfs is a filesystem client based on the SSH Filetransfer Protocol.
sshfs-fuse: Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy
sshfs-fuse: to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.
sshfs-fuse: On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging
sshfs-fuse: into the server with ssh.
sshfs-fuse: The idea of sshfs was taken from the SSHFS filesystem distributed
sshfs-fuse: with LUFS.
sshfs-fuse:
sshfs-fuse: sshfs lives at http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html
